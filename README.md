Over 15 thousand documents govern how the Departmentof Defense (DoD) operates. The documents exist in different repositories, often exist on different networks, are discoverable to different communities, are updated independently, and evolve rapidly. No single ability has ever existed that would enable navigation of the vast universe of governing requirements and guidance documents, leaving the Department unable to make evidence-based, data-driven decisions. Today GAMECHANGER offers a scalable solution with an authoritative corpus comprising a single trusted repository of all statutory and policy driven requirements based on Artificial-Intelligence (AI) enabled technologies.

### Repositories
